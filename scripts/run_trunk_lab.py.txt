# scripts/run_trunk_lab.py
# Baby Ansible – trunk lab runner for my Cisco homelab.
#
# I wrote this script to practice network automation without actually
# touching the real switches yet. Right now it:
#   - loads inventory.yaml (my lab switches and their IPs)
#   - loads tasks/trunk_lab.yaml (the commands I want to push)
#   - prints what it would send to each device (dry run only)
#
# Later I want to replace the print step with real SSH connections (Netmiko),
# so this file is basically my "brain" for planning changes.

with open("inventory.yaml") as f:
    inventory = yaml.safe_load(f)

# 2. Load trunk lab tasks from YAML file
with open("tasks/trunk_lab.yaml") as f:
    trunk_lab = yaml.safe_load(f)

# 3. Pull out the parts I care about from the YAML data
